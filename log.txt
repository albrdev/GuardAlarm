  Setting up and testing piezo speaker and the alarm triggering button, making classes for them both

  Testing 4x4 keypad, considered aking my own class to handle it, but then i found there already was one
  Setting up LEDs, testing with 220Ohm resistor at first, making a LED class, works fine.
  Tried making a Lerp method for the speaker class so I can lerp through 2 different values under a specific time making it sound like a siren, worked well except when value1 > value2, but recognized it to be a unsigned problem, just changed it to signed ints during the calculation then we cast it back to unsigned when done

  Managing "old" git repo to handle both server(computer/database etc.) and cient(Arduino) side
  Made a blink method for LED class

  Considering and testing out transmission via packets between Arduino and computer. Packets should have a type for the data/action/response and a checksum to verify that the data received is also (most likely) the data sent. We don't want data corruption or sync error to mess with alarm security (maybe this is overkill, but fun nevertheless).
  Checksums should be either the first or last bits in the packet for easier calculation.
  Checksums should not include itself in the calculation.

  Writing basics for keypad interaction. I want a string for the pin itself and an additional char for the options A and B. Also, to make it work like an actual pin code keypad we'll need to manage digit "overflow", i.e if I type 1234567, we'll want only 234567 (6 digits is pincode maxlength) to be sent. When a digit is typed, we'll check if max length is already reached, remove the first digit and then just add the new one
  Implemented basic serial communication using packets with checksums, sending typed in pin code successfully.
  Made a class for the piezo speaker
  Made a non-blocking blink method for LED class (still need to call this is the Arduino main loop though)
